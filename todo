1) Look into adding support for perhaps chrooting into the template and adding some specifyed packages....
    - Add in the config for updating/setting the correct time-zone for the template

2) Look into cleaning up the vz emerge script

3) look into perhaps instead of chroot in #1 have a post deployment script that
emerge/merges new packages into the system

4) Update the vzemerge script to double/triple check that XYZ portage directory
is arleady there, setup the make.profile properly/etc...




1) extend the stage3 -> openvz image script to do
a) open a file w/ a list of package to be installed
b) load a directory w/ a list of config/files

2) Can make it extend git so when git is pushed to, git will run a script to
update each machines as needed
3) profit


4) Just create some "machine-package" then "machine-specific-package" which are
"meta ebuilds" for what you want on each machine, then have a
"machine-specific-package" for like generic setup like dns, web-server, etc







VZLIST class

maybe define a "dataset object" that define what value/output that i am interested in such as ip, kmemsize, etc...
then pass that to the initializer of the vzlist so that it will spit out the values that i want, etc

need to do parsing and convert it into a nice hash for each ctid or something.



High level design idea:
Machine (Physical machine that the containers are on)
    Container (Each container)
	Various settings/options


Provide like a low level API like vzlist, vzctl, etc for those who wants procedural interface or to put together
their own management, but look into a high level object kind of hiechary in which you have a machine (ssh/local/etc) in
which it manages the actual machine that the containers are on.

Then have one container object for like each container, and it has various settings like create, destroy, etc... then
you can like "create a new container" but it won't happen on the openVZ machine till you do a "commit" or something which
bundles up all of the settings/changes and send it to the openvz machine

then finally the lowest level is the various settings/option like you got network, disk, quota, etc.... putting copying files,
     tweaking the container.


This won't have a template generator part in it for this iteration
